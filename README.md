# 🧠 Mall Customers Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Customer segmentation is a powerful technique used by businesses to understand their customers better. This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on their **age, annual income, spending behavior, and preferences**, enabling data-driven and targeted marketing strategies. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can optimize engagement, retention, and personalization efforts.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to:

* Segment customers into meaningful groups
* Analyze spending patterns and demographic characteristics
* Provide actionable insights for business decision-making


## 🔍 Dataset Features

The analysis focuses on the following customer attributes:

* **Age**
* **Annual Income**
* **Spending Score**
* **Customer Preferences (if available)**


## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Understand the distribution of key features
* Identify patterns, trends, and correlations
* Detect outliers and data inconsistencies
* Visualize customer behavior using statistical plots

### 2️⃣ Customer Segmentation with K-Means

* Apply **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers
* Use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
* Train and fit the clustering model on selected features

### 3️⃣ Visualization & Interpretation

* Visualize customer segments using **2D and 3D plots**
* Analyze cluster characteristics
* Interpret each segment to understand customer behavior and value


## 📊 Key Insights

Each cluster represents a unique customer group, such as:

* High-income high-spending customers
* Budget-conscious customers
* Young potential buyers
* Low-engagement customers

These insights help businesses tailor strategies for each segment.
